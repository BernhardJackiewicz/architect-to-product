Vibe coding generates code fast — but ships it without tests, with security holes, and with no deployment story. You spend more time fixing what the AI wrote than you saved.

- 45% of AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities — and coding agents will delete validation, disable auth, or relax database policies just to make errors go away
- "It works on my machine" turns into a 3am production incident

**architect-to-product** adds what vibe coding lacks: a structured pipeline from architecture to production. TDD ensures every feature works. SAST catches security issues before deploy. Stack-specific deployment configs mean you ship on day one, not day thirty.

## Without vs. With architect-to-product

| Without a2p | With a2p |
|---|---|
| Vibe code a feature | Architecture-driven vertical slices |
| Manually write some tests (maybe) | TDD per slice: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR |
| Miss security vulnerabilities | Automated SAST + OWASP Top 10 review |
| Copy-paste a Dockerfile from StackOverflow | Generated Dockerfile + docker-compose + Caddyfile + backup scripts |
| Hope for the best | Ship to production with confidence |

## Key Benefits

- **Develop faster** — Vertical slices with TDD, no yak shaving
- **Fewer bugs** — Every feature has tests before implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Ship secure** — Semgrep + Bandit + OWASP Top 10 review built into the workflow
- **Deploy on day one** — Stack-specific Dockerfile, docker-compose, Caddyfile, backup scripts
- **Any stack** — Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, C#, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

## How it works

```
Architecture → Plan → Build (TDD) → Security Gate → Deploy
```

For multi-phase projects (e.g. Phase 0: Spikes, Phase 1: MVP, Phase 2: Scale), this loop repeats per phase automatically.

```
Phase 0: Plan → Build → Security → Deploy → complete_phase
Phase 1: Plan → Build → Security → Deploy → complete_phase
...
```

1. **Onboarding**: Capture or co-develop the architecture. Detect database and frontend tech. Describe UI via text, upload wireframes/mockups/screenshots, or let AI generate a design concept. Set up companion MCP servers. If the architecture defines phases, they get extracted automatically.
2. **Planning**: Break the architecture into ordered vertical slices, each a deployable feature unit with acceptance criteria. Three slice types: `feature` (default), `integration` (library/API adapters with TDD), `infrastructure` (CI, auth, monitoring).
3. **Build Loop**: TDD per slice: RED (write failing tests) → GREEN (minimal implementation) → REFACTOR (clean up) → SAST (lightweight security scan). Frontend slices with `hasUI: true` get visual verification via Playwright between GREEN and REFACTOR. Configurable review checkpoints (`reviewMode`: `off`, `all`, `ui-only`) pause after slices for human approval. Domain logic triggers a WebSearch step before tests to verify facts (tax rates, regulations, standards).
4. **Security Gate**: Full SAST scan (Semgrep + Bandit), OWASP Top 10 manual review, dependency audit. Fix all critical/high findings.
5. **Deployment**: Generate Dockerfile, docker-compose, Caddyfile, backup scripts, hardening guides. Stack-specific launch checklist.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g architect-to-product

# Register in Claude Code
claude mcp add architect-to-product -- npx architect-to-product
```

Then restart Claude Code and use the `a2p` prompt. The onboarding will:
1. Co-develop or capture your architecture
2. Auto-generate a `.mcp.json` with all needed companion servers (database, Playwright, codebase-memory)
3. Install SAST tools (Semgrep, Bandit for Python) for the security gate
4. Ask you to restart Claude Code **once** — after that, everything is ready

No manual `claude mcp add` commands needed for companions.

## Client Configuration

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add architect-to-product -- npx architect-to-product
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "architect-to-product": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["architect-to-product"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "architect-to-product": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["architect-to-product"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json

  "servers": {
    "architect-to-product": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["architect-to-product"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Prompts (7)

Type these in Claude Code to trigger each workflow phase:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `a2p` | Start onboarding: define architecture, UI design, tech stack, companions |
| `a2p planning` | Break architecture into ordered vertical slices |
| `a2p build` | Build the current slice with TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → SAST) |
| `a2p refactor` | Analyze codebase for dead code, redundancy, coupling |
| `a2p e2e` | Run visual E2E tests with Playwright |
| `a2p security` | Full SAST scan + OWASP Top 10 review |
| `a2p deploy` | Generate deployment configs and launch checklist |

### When to use which prompt

You don't have to run the full pipeline. Each prompt works standalone — pick what you need:

**Full project from scratch:**
`a2p` → `a2p planning` → `a2p build` (repeat per slice) → `a2p security` → `a2p deploy`

**MVP built with vibe coding, now make it production-ready:**
- `a2p security` — find the vulnerabilities that vibe coding missed
- `a2p refactor` — clean up the spaghetti, remove dead code
- `a2p deploy` — generate Dockerfile, docker-compose, Caddyfile instead of guessing

**Added features without tests, need confidence before shipping:**
- `a2p refactor` — identify dead code and coupling from the feature sprawl
- `a2p e2e` — visually verify nothing is broken
- `a2p security` — catch injection, auth holes, hardcoded secrets

**Existing project, just need deployment:**
- `a2p deploy` — stack-specific configs, backup scripts, hardening guide

**Built the MVP with slices, now entering Phase 2:**
- `a2p planning` — create new slices for the next phase
- `a2p build` — TDD per slice as usual

> **Security note:** Companion MCPs are third-party software with access to your project files and databases. Before enabling a companion: check the source repo (author, stars, open issues), review the `.mcp.json` that gets generated, and confirm you trust the server. Official packages (`@modelcontextprotocol/*`, `@playwright/mcp`, `mcp.supabase.com`) are maintained by their respective organizations. Community packages are not audited by us — use at your own discretion.

## How is this different?

- **vs. Copilot / Cursor** — They generate snippets. a2p generates entire tested projects from architecture to deployment.
- **vs. create-\*-app scaffolders** — Static templates vs. dynamic architecture-driven generation with TDD and security gates.
- **vs. manual deployment setup** — Weeks of DevOps vs. generated configs on day one.
- **vs. vibe coding without a2p** — You ship fast but accumulate security debt, untested features, and manual deployment. a2p is the safety net that makes vibe coding production-viable.

## Disclaimer

This is not a guarantee of bug-free code. It's an engineering-grade safety net that catches what vibe coding misses.
